# instagram-skillbox
This is app like instagram, based on unsplash API. You can view news feed, open photos and like that.
For using skillboxgram you need account on unsplash.com.

This application is my final work of JavaScript course in skillbox.ru

Here i used my skills of React (i bad know him). I receive Promise from unsplash API, and used async/await for appears output data.
I would used library rxjs for transformations Promise in Observable. Work with stream it's really better nice than Promise. But, i'm not do it. May be in last version i recoding into Observable by apply rxjs.
